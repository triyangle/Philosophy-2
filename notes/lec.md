    Socrates/Plato
* Confucius defines parameters of Chinese thought (even more so than
    Socrates/Plato do for Western thought)
* Plato/Socrates = argumentative philosophers (challenging others' beliefs)
* Confucius *Analects* = expository philosophy
    * Exposition of viewpoint with reasons/arguments behind it (but arguments
        not present in text as they would be in Plato/Socrates writing)
* Socrates/Plato = more abstract view of ethics

### Agreement Between Aristotle & Confucius
* Look at individual actions in context of whole (ethical "holism")

### Differences ""
* Confucius: Human good (humanity) = many different things
* Aristotle = single unitary happiness

### Means/Ends
* Aim at happiness for its own sake (ends)

### Functionalist View

### Eudaimonía
* Single life condition
* Both subjective & External objective condition

### Family vs. Polis
* Aristotle → need entire polis to live a full life
* Political communtiy = framework for individual/ethical

### 3 Parts of Life
* Linguistic capacity
* Highest aspect of existence = contemplation of existence

# Lec : 9/30/19
* Jewish exodus = time of Moses
* *lex talionis* = law of retribution
    * Justice as balance/equity/equality
* Mosaic law has moral and contractual aspect to it

## Rule Based Systems
* Divine authorities vs authorities of the state

### Why do we have social rules, secular and moral law?
* Allows new, more complex forms of cooperation
* Writing makes rules visible and stabilizes them
    * Writing and rule-following correlated
* Writing, rule-following, stabilizing, setting up empires/kingdoms all related

## Kant and the autonomy of morals
* Rethinking idea of moral code
* Rule-based ethics
* Rules can come from beyond outside, "moral law within me"
* Observation/experience insufficient to base moral law upon
    * Experience not universal, but moral laws are
* Not pluralist, only single universal moral law
* Universal laws should hold for all rational beings without exception → can't
    be based on just human nature
* *Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals*
    * Arguing against Aristotle:
        * Happiness irrelevant, only relevant to how we as humans are
        * Need to set aside to figure out universal moral law
        * Well-being different from well-doing
            * Good life achieved my immoral ends
    * Arguing against divine authority
        * Need standard of morality to judge perfectness/morality of God
            * Israelites needed notion of moral good in order to judge divine
                authority of God
            * Existence of moral law underwrites belief in God 
                * Notion of God arises from pre-existing moral notions
        * If no previous standard of morality, then law imposed on people because of supreme being is not moral
    * Heteronomy = rule by outsider
    * Question of why in response to order to follow moral law → recognition
        of authority of moral law comes from within

# 10/2/19
## Modern Ethics
* Notions of duty/obligation more Protestant than Judeo-Christian
* Distinct individual separate from society
* Confucian family → religious community of Israelites
* Ethics originating from individual, but with universal validity

## Purity of the Moral Law
* Ethics → obligation

### *a priori*
* Independent of experience/observation

### Empricisim
* All knowledge from experience, etc.
    * All knowledge is *a posteriori*

* Must do good out of duty/obligation → moral action
    * Independent of feelings
* Connections between causes/effects
* Universal claims cannot be derived from observations

* Perception can be wrong sometimes, reason/logos always true
    * - Some Greek philosopher
* "Logos" has multiplicity of meanings (word, sentence, etc.)
    * Language central to meaning
* Thought is never pure → always affected by something
* Need to think abstracted from factors as basis for morality

* Hegel: Can't get substantive moral conclusions out of nothing (pure formal
    reasoning)

# Need for an Ultimate Moral Law
* Can't be satisfied w/ traditional way moral laws are expressed
* Need systematic, quasi-scientific ethics
* Axiomatic assumptions → derive things systematically

* Concrete moral rules regulate actions (first order moral principles)
* Higher order moral principle tells us how to choose first order moral
    principles (low order moral principles, maxims) → categorical imperative

# 10/7/19
* Kant → sentiment is irrelevant

## Buddha
* First represented via abstract structures
* Zen Buddhism vs Buddhism w/ gods

## Siddhartha Gautama
* **Vedic religion:** fire worshipped
    * Temple built on spot of fire ritual, then destroyed
* **Yogic asceticism:** rejecting world, devotion to meditation

### Enlightenment
* Universe = cyclic
    * Suffering inevitable b/c it is part of cycle
        * Life in vain
    * Desires bind us to world and produce suffering
        * Desires never completely satisfied
    * Overcome/escape suffering → overcome desires

### The Middle Way
* Pursuit of pain/hardship = yogic ascetic
* **Nirvana:** End goal of human life = achieve nothingness

* Buddha died from eating spoiled pork (was vegetarian to respect life but would eat meat if
    offered)

* Need compassion for others and ourselves

### Questions
* Moral discrimination absent from Buddhism
* Universal compassion not enough → passive attitude
    * Ethics that doesn't call for action
* Based on personal individual vision, basing common general ethics on personal
    viewpoint?

## Tentative Typology of Ethics
* **Nietzsche:** Layout different viewpoints together into a typology of ethics
* Mosaic/Kantian codes based on legalistic thinking of ancient Middle-Eastern
    courts
* Feeling/sentiment based → right attitude/way to relate to others,
    interpersonal

* Need rational criterion to determine when feelings are appropriate
* Reason to incorporate feelings into ethical thinking → utilitarianism
