    selfishness which is using society for only oneself's ambitions/purposes

# Lec 4: 9/6/19
* Plato - need leaders who understand ultimate outcomes/goals
    * Values as in addition to technical thought

    (b/c Socrates prosecuted)

* Independence/freedom/democracy of Athens lost after Alexander the Great

# Lec 6: 9/11/19
* Socrates/Plato laid foundations of Western thought → Confucius is both
    Socrates/Plato
* Confucius defines parameters of Chinese thought (even more so than
    Socrates/Plato do for Western thought)
* Plato/Socrates = argumentative philosophers (challenging others' beliefs)
* Confucius *Analects* = expository philosophy
    * Exposition of viewpoint with reasons/arguments behind it (but arguments
        not present in text as they would be in Plato/Socrates writing)
* Socrates/Plato = more abstract view of ethics
* Confucius = more historical perspective of ethics
* Communists believed Confucianism led to stagnation of China
* Harmony central to Confucian thought
* Harmony must follow ritual
    * Need established practices/rules (common understanding) to have harmony
* Ritual has social dimension

# Lec 7: 9/13/19

* Tight family bonds can lead to social corruption

## 3. Friendship
* Open up to other ways of thinking, enable/open more broad-mindedness
* Matteo Ricci translates between Western and Chinese culture

# Lec 9: 9/18/19
## Aristotle

* *Nichomachean Ethics* → inconsistencies from editing over years

### Agreement Between Aristotle & Confucius
* Look at individual actions in context of whole (ethical "holism")

### Differences ""
* Confucius: Human good (humanity) = many different things
* Aristotle = single unitary happiness

### Means/Ends
* Aim at happiness for its own sake (ends)

### Functionalist View

### Eudaimonía
* Single life condition
* Both subjective & External objective condition

### Family vs. Polis
* Aristotle → need entire polis to live a full life
* Political communtiy = framework for individual/ethical

### 3 Parts of Life
* Linguistic capacity
* Highest aspect of existence = contemplation of existence

### Moral luck
* No full control over circumstances in life
* Recognize moral luckiness of others → achieve full human happiness

### Concluding Notes
* Happiness = objective condition of human circumstances

# Lec : 9/30/19
* Jewish exodus = time of Moses
* *lex talionis* = law of retribution
    * Justice as balance/equity/equality
* Mosaic law has moral and contractual aspect to it

## Rule Based Systems
* Divine authorities vs authorities of the state

### Why do we have social rules, secular and moral law?
* Allows new, more complex forms of cooperation
* Writing makes rules visible and stabilizes them
    * Writing and rule-following correlated
* Writing, rule-following, stabilizing, setting up empires/kingdoms all related

## Kant and the autonomy of morals
* Rethinking idea of moral code
* Rule-based ethics
* Rules can come from beyond outside, "moral law within me"
* Observation/experience insufficient to base moral law upon
    * Experience not universal, but moral laws are
* Not pluralist, only single universal moral law
* Universal laws should hold for all rational beings without exception → can't
    be based on just human nature
* *Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals*
    * Arguing against Aristotle:
        * Happiness irrelevant, only relevant to how we as humans are
        * Need to set aside to figure out universal moral law
        * Well-being different from well-doing
            * Good life achieved my immoral ends
    * Arguing against divine authority
        * Need standard of morality to judge perfectness/morality of God
            * Israelites needed notion of moral good in order to judge divine
                authority of God
            * Existence of moral law underwrites belief in God
                * Notion of God arises from pre-existing moral notions
        * If no previous standard of morality, then law imposed on people because of supreme being is not moral
    * Heteronomy = rule by outsider
    * Question of why in response to order to follow moral law → recognition
        of authority of moral law comes from within

# 10/2/19
## Modern Ethics
* Notions of duty/obligation more Protestant than Judeo-Christian
* Distinct individual separate from society
* Confucian family → religious community of Israelites
* Ethics originating from individual, but with universal validity

## Purity of the Moral Law
* Ethics → obligation

### *a priori*
* Independent of experience/observation

### Empricisim
* All knowledge from experience, etc.
    * All knowledge is *a posteriori*

* Must do good out of duty/obligation → moral action
    * Independent of feelings
* Connections between causes/effects
* Universal claims cannot be derived from observations

* Perception can be wrong sometimes, reason/logos always true
    * –Some Greek philosopher
* "Logos" has multiplicity of meanings (word, sentence, etc.)
    * Language central to meaning
* Thought is never pure → always affected by something
* Need to think abstracted from factors as basis for morality

* Hegel: Can't get substantive moral conclusions out of nothing (pure formal
    reasoning)

# Need for an Ultimate Moral Law
* Can't be satisfied w/ traditional way moral laws are expressed
* Need systematic, quasi-scientific ethics
* Axiomatic assumptions → derive things systematically

* Concrete moral rules regulate actions (first order moral principles)
* Higher order moral principle tells us how to choose first order moral
    principles (low order moral principles, maxims) → categorical imperative

# 10/7/19
* Kant → sentiment is irrelevant

## Buddha
* First represented via abstract structures
* Zen Buddhism vs Buddhism w/ gods

## Siddhartha Gautama
* **Vedic religion:** fire worshipped
    * Temple built on spot of fire ritual, then destroyed
* **Yogic asceticism:** rejecting world, devotion to meditation

### Enlightenment
* Universe = cyclic
    * Suffering inevitable b/c it is part of cycle
        * Life in vain
    * Desires bind us to world and produce suffering
        * Desires never completely satisfied
    * Overcome/escape suffering → overcome desires

### The Middle Way
* Pursuit of pain/hardship = yogic ascetic
* **Nirvana:** End goal of human life = achieve nothingness

* Buddha died from eating spoiled pork (was vegetarian to respect life but would eat meat if
    offered)

* Need compassion for others and ourselves

### Questions
* Moral discrimination absent from Buddhism
* Universal compassion not enough → passive attitude
    * Ethics that doesn't call for action
* Based on personal individual vision, basing common general ethics on personal
    viewpoint?

## Tentative Typology of Ethics
* **Nietzsche:** Layout different viewpoints together into a typology of ethics
* Mosaic/Kantian codes based on legalistic thinking of ancient Middle-Eastern
    courts
* Feeling/sentiment based → right attitude/way to relate to others,
    interpersonal

* Need rational criterion to determine when feelings are appropriate
* Reason to incorporate feelings into ethical thinking → utilitarianism

# 10/21/19
* State we belong to → involuntary community
    * Does modern state consist of contract (like voluntary communities, e.g.
        clubs)?
        * Hans: No, state doesn't originate w/ a contract (not corporation)

* Common good not fixed, decided on in different ways under different
    conditions
    * Political process/struggle = process of choosing/deciding common good
        * Pluralistic view of common good
            * Happiness = multi-formed, pluralistic
                * Consists of many facets/things

* Tradeoff between freedom and security, oppositional relations w/ each other
* Socialist = maintain society's social structure (more conservative)

* Democritus = materialist

## 7 Takeaways
* Plato: politics = product of god-forsaken world *The Politician*
* Humans deficient creatures → need to make up with artificial culture, etc.
* Democracy always an aspiration, never fully there (don't always hear voice of
    everyone)

* Plato: reject equality, experts determine much of politics/society
    * More Platonic than Protagorean state

# 10/23/19
## Protagoras
* First to theorize about democracy (why is it the most appropriate form of
    gov't)
* Democracy most easiest/fundamental conceptualization of politics
    * Everyone comes together to decide how to live
    * **Marx:** All gov't is voluntary cooperation at core

* Democracy not possible in mass scale

        * Open up people to world/realities around them
        * Can't participate in democratic decision making if ppl are uninformed
            * *Washington Post:* Ppl ignorant of Syria's locations wanted to bomb it more

## Plato (rule of experts)
* Only few are qualified to go through necessary training and act/make
    political decisions
* Inequality = basic fact of life
    * Allegory of the cave
* Philosophers only ones qualified to rule state (only ones outside of cave)
* Trained by him/philosophers

* Oligarchs = plutocrats
* Democracy w/out laws too incompetent to do anything → won't do any harm
* Rule by philosopher kings = best

## Aristotle and "republican" Gov't
* Humans political by nature
    * Human nature = necessary to act politically
* Gregarious/social animals already political
    * Social interaction = characteristic of politics

* Humans also deliberate and decide what to do
    * Bees always go for flowers (can't deliberate about choices)
    * Process of choice-making/deliberation = human characteristic of politics

* **Aristotle:** Some ppl naturally slaves (better of slaves)
* Slavery in U.S. justified via Old Testament (Mosaic Law) and Aristotle
* Last relationship = friendship, hold cities together
    * Underlies social/political relationship
    * Voluntary/chosen, allows for equality → domain for politics
        * Respect/recognition for each other, origins/roots of politics
        * Politics → capable of overcoming basic relationships of inequality

* Oligarchy → capitalism
* **Aristotle:** Best form of gov't = politeia → republic

* Aristotle critical of radical democracy and Plato
* Philosophers don't know how to govern state

* Polis = city-state
    * All human life can take place
    * Theaters/temples/grand city
    * Too large, bonds of affection/friendship loosened
    * Institution of moderate size
    * Generous, but temperate (live well but not too well)

* Household serves purposes of reproduction/survival, immediate practical needs
* Village = long-term economic/other needs
    * Not only concerned w/ survival, but also living well

* Politics → employ human reason to deliberate what is good/etc.

* Political community exists by nature
    * Individuals secondary to political community
    * Politics has potential to make us who we are
        * Person who made it is human-kind's greatest benefactor

* Politics → human nature → based on animal nature

* Overcome innate hostility and drive for aggression (biological determinants), mitigate/control
    * Don't need to go to extremes, learn to acquire habits/virtues → make
        social living possible

* **Arendt:** Politics can make us more fully human → not grounded in human
    nature

# 10/30/19
## Aristotle
* Democracy not best form, but republic
    * Only the qualified few should rule
* Christianity = conflict between new religion and previous political order →
    separation of church and state
    * Christians develop own welfare system, etc. churches, bishops
        * Separate from Roman empire
        * Separation of 2 worlds
        * Distinctly European/Western
* **Individualism:** What really matters is self → separation from society/self
    * Society/state = obstacle to individual & pursuit of self

## Arendt
* **Arendt:** Humanity can destroy itself via politics

## The *Leviathan*
* **Hobbes:** State → machine
    * Hobbes lived in time of war → maybe predisposed to have more negative
        view of state/conflict/human nature

* Diffidence → fear
    * Always in fear of others
    * Gang warfare
* Glory → pursuit of victory

* Industry = economic development

* **Contract theory of the state:** Give up liberties to ruler to
    control/maintain order
    * In order to make contract need shared language/understanding, state of
        trust, but state
        of nature doesn't allow this

* Contract = post-hoc event
* Political order = based/founded on violence

* Violence remains in political order
* State emerges as an act of violence in order to escape violence
    * Threat of violence always present even in state

## Weber
* State is system of violence/force
* Maintains claim to monopoly of legitimate use of violence
    * Prohibits individual use of violence against each other
    * State uses violence to enforce rules/punishment

* International relations → nations still treat each other like wolves

## Political Disillusionment
* Political power = oppression

## Modern Liberalism
* Distrust of political order → minimal state needed, maximize individual
    liberties/freedoms

* Libertarianism = more self-centered individualistic society

# 11/4/19
* John Stuart Mill → individualistic view
* Extreme individualism or community both potentially problematic

## Protagoras
* aidōs, sense of awe

* Lex talionis = conceptualization of justice
    * Restore balance

### Justice vs Fairness
* Fairness = more local, colloquial concept

## Plato
* Inegalitarian
* Democracy wrong b/c treats everyone as equal (but ppl are not equal)

## Aristotle
* Also not an egalitarian

* Proportional rights relative to position in society

* Equity/justice can have unequal treatment under certain conditions (e.g.
    slaves)

* Social/political/cultural upheaval 1968 → question of relevance for
    school topics (i.e. philosophy)

* Communitarian → socialism

## Rawls
* Conception of politics focused entirely on only justice (as opposed to
    friendship, etc. from before)
* Social/political existence = part of good life, fundamental issue = good life

* Need mechanism to live together in presence of opposing or no common values
    * Agreement in disagreement
* Splits apart individual justice and justice of social institutions
    * Privatize individual justice, maintain social justice
* Fairness = social issue
* Rawls → explain justice in terms of fairness
* Rawls social justice → liberalism allows some degree of inequality, similar to Plato/Aristotle
    * Justice not complete equality, allows some degree of inequality

* Aristotle = absolute sense of justice/fairness
* Equity = conditional equality
    * Recognized by Plato/Aristotle, not equality

* Liberal society can't coexist with unreasonable views
    * Adapt, find way to live together despite disagreements
* No answer to plurality of morality that exists in modern society (ppl too
    different)
