## Kant CI
* **Hypothetical** vs **categorical** imperative
    * **Hypothetical:** if ... x ... then do y
    * **Categorical:** do y
        * "Act only on the maxim which you can, at the same time, will that it
            should become a universal law"
            * Maxim = statement of action
                * "I will lie to everyone"
            * Universal law = applicable to everyone/at all times, law of
                nature
                * "Everyone lies to everyone"
                    * No trust → no social interactions → no others/comm. → no
                        moral
        * **Moral principle:** Source that explains why something is or isn't moral
* 2nd-order principle (CI) → 1st-order principles (maxims) → action
* Why does Kant value rationality so much?
    * 2 aspects to being human
        1. Rationality/reason
            * Logical thinking, community
            * Morality based here, shared by everyone
        2. Sensibility, sentiments/feelings/desires/appetites/inclinations
            * Up to chance, contingent
* No moral worth $\not=$ immoral/wrong
